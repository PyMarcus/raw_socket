# raw_socket
  Raw sockets allow new IPv4 protocols to be implemented in user        space.  A raw socket receives or sends the raw datagram not        including link level headers.         The IPv4 layer generates an IP header when sending a packet        unless the IP_HDRINCL socket option is enabled on the socket.        When it is enabled, the packet must contain an IP header.  For        receiving, the IP header is always included in the packet.         In order to create a raw socket, a process must have the        CAP_NET_RAW capability in the user namespace that governs its        network namespace.
